Define the arrays of pronouns, adjectives, and nouns:
pronoun = ['the', 'our'];
adj = ['great', 'big'];
noun = ['jogger', 'racoon'];

Define the array of extensions:
extensions = ['.com', '.net', '.us', '.io'];

Create an empty array to store the generated domain names:
domainNames = [];

Iterate over each pronoun:
for each pr in pronoun:

Iterate over each adjective:
for each adjWord in adj:

Iterate over each noun:
for each nounWord in noun:

Iterate over each extension:
for each ext in extensions:

Concatenate the words and extension to form a domain name:
domain = pr + adjWord + nounWord + ext;

Add the domain name to the array of domain names:
domainNames.push(domain);
